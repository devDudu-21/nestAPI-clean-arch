## Description

This practical project involves the creation of a Restful API using Node.js, NestJS, and TypeScript, oriented towards automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests), applying concepts of Domain Driven Design (DDD), Clean Architecture, Design Patterns, and SOLID principles.

The project consists of a user module with: entity, data validation, repositories, use cases, CRUD functionality, pagination of data returned in lists, JWT authentication, and automated tests within an architecture based on DDD and Clean Architecture concepts.
